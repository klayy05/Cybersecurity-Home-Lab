# Cybersecurity-Home-Lab

## Objective

The Cybersecurity Home Lab project aimed to establish a virtualized controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to simulate a basic network attack and implement defensive measures, to analyze network traffic using specialized tools. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, defensive strategies and gain proficiency in setting up and managing virtual machines.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in Network fundamentals.
- Proficiency in analyzing network traffic.
- Proficiency in Linux Operating system basics.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
